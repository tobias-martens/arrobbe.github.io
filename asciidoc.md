| **Main Contribution or Finding**
| Informational (not energetic) masking is prominent for simultaneous speech signals, and highly dependent on the voice similarity.
| Glimpses (spectro-temporal regions where the speech signal is more energetic than the background) help in distinguishing.
| Unmasking cues such as masker gender, spatial separation, and time reversal improve speech intelligibility and reduce listening effort.
| Lombard speaking style data and SSDRC (Spectral Shaping and Dynamic Range Compression) significantly improve TTS intelligibility.
| Overview of auditory masking and key definitions.

== Short overview

Masking describes the effect that the presence of other sound sources has on a target sound, for example speech from a specific person. Depending on strength and type of the masking sounds, the target sound may become unintelligible. Two types, 1. energetic masking (e.g. Gaussian noise overlay), and 2. informational masking (a collector term for all other effects imposed by e.g. human speech noise, including auditory but also psychological ones), are distinguished.

We are quite good at distinguishing human target speech from white noise and also masking speech (cocktail party effect) by audiovisual cues and listening effort.
Intelligibility of TTS speech as a target sound suffers more from background noise, but can be improved by using Lombard speaking style data and spectral shaping.
